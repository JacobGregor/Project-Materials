# Team-Agreement
Agreement for our 201-Group Project
Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.
Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

-> Communication and team checks each morning well run through what each member of the team hopes to achieve that day and help eachother set a scope for what realistically can get done that day. we WILL make sure everyones voice is heard and everypone has a say on what our mission/goals are for each section of the project. 

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

-> Speaking up (hopefully). we have really highlited communication in our discussions thus far and plan to incorporate ALL team members input into our daily/overall project goals/outcome. 

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

-> leveraging eachothers strengths and making sure that nobody stays stuck on a problem. Essetially creating a space where we as a group feel comfortable reaching out and asking for help. 


How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

-> Our mission is to incorporate the a slice of eachothers individual ideas into the collective final product. Making sure evryone has contributed and has "skin-in-the-game" for our final outcome is imperative to creating a cohesive working group. 


How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If multiple attempts to bring the conflict to a close we will have to reach out for support. We do not anticipate for this outcome and will strive to avoid it, but if need be we have agreed to this.. 


Communication Plan.


Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Group Communication (See above)

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Work Plan

-> Nobody be mean. 

-> we spoke a lot about accountability and making sure everyone is on the same page. we are a group of individuals coming together to learn something we are passionate about, we arent here to lose our heads on a group project. 

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
